## Vision

Joysmith is currently a methodology repo — templates, research, and manual workflows that get applied to projects through conversation with Claude. The friction is high: you have to know the templates exist, point Claude at them, and manually shepherd the process every time.

This feature turns Joysmith into a distributable tool that anyone can install and run. The tool has two parts:

1. **`npx joysmith init`** — A thin CLI that scaffolds the Joysmith harness into any project. It auto-detects the tech stack, copies skills and templates, creates or improves CLAUDE.md, sets up the docs/ directory structure, and optionally registers hooks. After init, everything is native Claude Code — no external dependencies, no API keys, no running servers.

2. **Claude Code skills** (installed by init) — `/joysmith` as the main entry point. It detects the project's current state: no harness (scaffold), partial harness (assess + upgrade), or full harness (ready to work). It runs assessments, scores the project against the 5-level framework, identifies gaps, and provides a concrete upgrade plan. It installs the full interview → brief → decompose → atomic specs → execute → discoveries workflow.

The goal: take any project from wherever it is to as close to Level 4 as the infrastructure can get it, then light the path to Level 5. Joysmith doesn't build features or write project code — it builds the *system* that enables Level 4+ development.

This is open source. Anyone with a Claude Code or Codex project can run `npx joysmith init` and immediately have a dramatically better harness.

## User Stories

- As a developer starting a new project, I want to run `npx joysmith init` and immediately have a production-quality CLAUDE.md, behavioral boundaries, skills, and documentation structure so I start at Level 3.5+ instead of Level 1.
- As a developer with an existing project, I want to run `/joysmith` inside Claude Code and get an honest assessment of my harness quality with specific, actionable steps to improve it.
- As a developer who just got assessed, I want Joysmith to apply the recommended upgrades to my project — improve my CLAUDE.md, add missing skills, create the docs/ structure — so I don't have to do it manually.
- As a developer at Level 4, I want the installed skills (`/new-feature`, `/decompose`, `/session-end`) to guide my workflow so I naturally follow the interview → spec → execute → discoveries pattern.
- As a developer six months later, I want to run `npx joysmith upgrade` and get the latest templates and skills merged into my project without losing my customizations.

## Hard Constraints

- MUST work inside Claude Code sessions — skills are the primary interface, not a standalone CLI
- MUST NOT require `--dangerously-skip-permissions` — the tool should work within normal Claude Code permission flows
- MUST NOT require API keys, running servers, or external services — everything runs locally via Claude Code
- MUST be language/stack agnostic — templates are markdown, only build/test/lint commands are stack-specific
- MUST preserve existing user customizations when upgrading — never overwrite user modifications to CLAUDE.md or templates
- MUST auto-detect tech stack from manifest files (package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, go.mod, Package.swift, Makefile, etc.)
- SHOULD copy templates into the project (user owns them, can modify) rather than referencing a central location
- SHOULD work with both Claude Code and Codex (AGENTS.md support)

## Out of Scope

- NOT: Writing project-specific specs, features, or code — Joysmith provides infrastructure, not implementation
- NOT: Running tests or CI/CD — Joysmith sets up the structure for these but doesn't execute them
- NOT: MCP server — unnecessary complexity for what is fundamentally file scaffolding + Claude Code skills
- NOT: Web UI or dashboard — this is a CLI + skills tool
- NOT: Hosting or cloud features — everything is local
- NOT: Building external scenarios for the user — Joysmith explains what they are and provides the template, but scenario design is project-specific work
- NOT: Integration with specific CI providers (GitHub Actions, etc.) — future concern
- NOT: Automated Level 5 features (spec queues, autonomous feedback loops) — the tool gets you to 4 and shows the path to 5

## Decomposition

| # | Spec Name | Description | Dependencies | Est. Size |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | init-cli-scaffold | `npx joysmith init` — detect stack, scaffold dirs, copy templates/skills, create/improve CLAUDE.md | None | L |
| 2 | assess-skill | `/joysmith` skill — detect harness state, score against 5-level framework, output assessment + upgrade plan | None | M |
| 3 | upgrade-apply-skill | After assessment, apply recommended upgrades — improve CLAUDE.md, add missing skills/templates/dirs | Spec 2 | M |
| 4 | new-feature-skill | `/new-feature` skill — interview → Feature Brief (adapted from current template for installed use) | Spec 1 | S |
| 5 | decompose-skill | `/decompose` skill — break Feature Brief into atomic specs (adapted from current template) | Spec 1 | S |
| 6 | session-end-skill | `/session-end` skill — discoveries pattern, verify, commit (adapted from current template) | Spec 1 | S |
| 7 | upgrade-cli-command | `npx joysmith upgrade` — diff installed templates against latest, offer updates, preserve customizations | Spec 1 | M |
| 8 | stack-detection | Auto-detect tech stack from manifest files, populate CLAUDE.md with correct build/test/lint/deploy commands | None | S |
| 9 | agents-md-support | Generate AGENTS.md alongside CLAUDE.md for Codex compatibility | Spec 1 | S |

**Dependency graph:**
```
Spec 8 (stack detection) ──┐
                           ├──→ Spec 1 (init CLI) ──→ Specs 4, 5, 6 (workflow skills)
Spec 2 (assess skill) ─────┤                     └──→ Spec 7 (upgrade CLI)
                           │                     └──→ Spec 9 (AGENTS.md)
Spec 3 (upgrade-apply) ←───┘
```

Specs 8 and 2 can start in parallel. Spec 1 depends on 8. Specs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 depend on 1. Spec 3 depends on 2.

## Execution Strategy

- [x] Mixed (some parallel, some sequential)

**Phase 1 (parallel):**
| Worktree | Specs | Branch |
|----------|-------|--------|
| main | Spec 8 (stack-detection) | `feature/stack-detection` |
| worktree-2 | Spec 2 (assess-skill) | `feature/assess-skill` |

**Phase 2 (after Phase 1 merges):**
| Worktree | Specs | Branch |
|----------|-------|--------|
| main | Spec 1 (init-cli) | `feature/init-cli` |
| worktree-2 | Spec 3 (upgrade-apply) | `feature/upgrade-apply` |

**Phase 3 (parallel, after Spec 1 merges):**
| Worktree | Specs | Branch |
|----------|-------|--------|
| main | Specs 4 + 5 + 6 (workflow skills — small, do together) | `feature/workflow-skills` |
| worktree-2 | Spec 7 (upgrade CLI) | `feature/upgrade-cli` |
| worktree-3 | Spec 9 (AGENTS.md) | `feature/agents-md` |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] `npx joysmith init` in a fresh Node.js project creates: CLAUDE.md with boundaries, docs/ structure (briefs/, specs/, discoveries/, contracts/, decisions/), .claude/skills/ with all workflow skills, and correct build/test/lint commands
- [ ] `npx joysmith init` in a fresh Python project creates the same structure with Python-appropriate commands
- [ ] `npx joysmith init` in a project with an existing CLAUDE.md improves it (adds boundaries, architecture section, workflow section) without destroying existing content
- [ ] Running `/joysmith` inside Claude Code on an un-harnessed project produces an assessment with level score, dimension scores, and actionable recommendations
- [ ] Running `/joysmith` on a fully harnessed project says "harness looks good" and offers to start work
- [ ] `/new-feature` → `/decompose` → `/session-end` workflow runs end-to-end producing a Feature Brief, N atomic specs, and a DISCOVERIES.md
- [ ] `npx joysmith upgrade` on a project initialized 1+ versions ago updates templates without overwriting user customizations
- [ ] All of the above works without `--dangerously-skip-permissions`

## External Scenarios

| Scenario | What It Tests | Pass Criteria |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Fresh Node.js project (create-next-app) | init scaffolds correctly for JS ecosystem | CLAUDE.md has `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`, correct dir structure |
| Fresh Python project (poetry new) | init scaffolds correctly for Python ecosystem | CLAUDE.md has `pytest`, `mypy`, correct dir structure |
| Fresh Rust project (cargo new) | init scaffolds correctly for Rust ecosystem | CLAUDE.md has `cargo test`, `cargo clippy`, correct dir structure |
| Existing project with minimal CLAUDE.md | init improves without destroying | Original content preserved, boundaries added, dirs created |
| Existing project with full Joysmith harness | `/joysmith` recognizes it's already set up | No redundant scaffolding, assessment shows Level 3.5+ |
| Messy real-world project (multiple configs, monorepo) | Stack detection handles complexity | Detects primary stack, doesn't crash on ambiguity |
| Upgrade after template evolution | `npx joysmith upgrade` merges changes | New templates added, modified templates offered as diff, user customizations preserved |

## Template Usage Notes

This brief was produced through the Joysmith interview process (3 rounds of questions). The decomposition identifies 9 atomic specs across 3 phases. Total estimated effort: 8-12 sessions.

The `npx joysmith init` approach means the npm package is a thin scaffolder — the real value is in the installed skills and templates that run natively in Claude Code. This keeps the tool simple, dependency-free, and aligned with the constraint that it must feel native to Claude Code/Codex.
