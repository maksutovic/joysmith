# Level 5: The Autonomous Loop — Full Guide

> [Back to README](../../README.md)

This guide covers the full architecture, setup, and operation of Joycraft's Level 5 autonomous development loop. For a quick overview, see the [Level 5 section in the README](../../README.md#level-5-the-autonomous-loop).

---

> **A note on complexity:** Setting up Level 5 does have some moving parts and, depending on the complexity of your stack (software vs. hardware, monorepo vs. single app, etc.), this will require a good amount of prompting and trial-and-error to get right. I've done my best to make this as painless as possible, but just note - this is not a one-shot-prompt-done-in-5-minutes kind of thing. For small projects and simple stacks it will be easy, but any level of complexity is going to take some iteration, so plan ahead. Full step-by-step guides along with a video coming soon.

Level 5 is where specs go in and validated software comes out. Joycraft implements this as four interlocking GitHub Actions workflows, a separate scenarios repository, and two independent AI agents that can never see each other's work.

Run `/joycraft-implement-level5` in Claude Code for a guided setup, or use the CLI directly:

```bash
npx joycraft init-autofix --scenarios-repo my-project-scenarios --app-id 3180156
```

### Architecture Overview

Level 5 has four moving parts. Each is a GitHub Actions workflow that communicates via `repository_dispatch` events. No custom servers, no webhooks, no external services.

### The Four Workflows

#### 1. Autofix Workflow (`autofix.yml`)

Triggered when CI **fails** on a PR. Claude Code CLI reads the failure logs and attempts a fix.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CI as CI Workflow
    participant AF as Autofix Workflow
    participant Claude as Claude Code CLI
    participant PR as Pull Request

    CI->>AF: workflow_run (conclusion: failure)
    AF->>AF: Generate GitHub App token
    AF->>AF: Checkout PR branch
    AF->>AF: Count previous autofix attempts

    alt attempts >= 3
        AF->>PR: Comment: "Human review needed"
    else attempts < 3
        AF->>AF: Fetch CI failure logs
        AF->>AF: Strip ANSI codes
        AF->>Claude: claude -p "Fix this CI failure..." <br/> --dangerously-skip-permissions --max-turns 20
        Claude->>Claude: Read logs, edit code, run tests
        Claude->>AF: Exit (changes committed locally)
        AF->>PR: Push fix (commit prefix: "autofix:")
        AF->>PR: Comment: summary of fix
        Note over CI,PR: CI re-runs automatically on push
    end
```

**Key details:**
- Uses a GitHub App identity for pushes to avoid GitHub's anti-recursion protection
- Concurrency group per PR so only one autofix runs at a time
- Max 3 iterations, then posts "human review needed"
- No `--model` flag. Claude CLI handles model selection.
- Strips ANSI escape codes from logs so Claude gets clean text

#### 2. Scenarios Dispatch Workflow (`scenarios-dispatch.yml`)

Triggered when CI **passes** on a PR. Fires a `repository_dispatch` to the scenarios repo to run holdout tests against the PR branch.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CI as CI Workflow
    participant SD as Scenarios Dispatch
    participant SR as Scenarios Repo

    CI->>SD: workflow_run (conclusion: success, PR)
    SD->>SD: Generate GitHub App token
    SD->>SR: repository_dispatch: run-scenarios<br/>payload: {pr_number, branch, sha, repo}
```

#### 3. Spec Dispatch Workflow (`spec-dispatch.yml`)

Triggered when spec files are pushed to `main`. Sends the spec content to the scenarios repo so the scenario agent can write tests.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant Main as Main Repo (push to main)
    participant SPD as Spec Dispatch Workflow
    participant SR as Scenarios Repo

    Dev->>Main: Push specs to docs/specs/
    Main->>SPD: push event (docs/specs/** changed)
    SPD->>SPD: git diff --diff-filter=AM (added/modified only)

    loop For each changed spec
        SPD->>SR: repository_dispatch: spec-pushed<br/>payload: {spec_filename, spec_content, commit_sha, branch, repo}
    end

    Note over SPD: Deleted specs are ignored -<br/>existing scenario tests remain
```

#### 4. Scenarios Re-run Workflow (`scenarios-rerun.yml`)

Triggered when the scenarios repo updates its tests. Re-dispatches all open PRs to the scenarios repo so they get tested with the latest holdout tests.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SR as Scenarios Repo
    participant RR as Re-run Workflow
    participant SRun as Scenarios Run

    SR->>RR: repository_dispatch: scenarios-updated
    RR->>RR: List open PRs via GitHub API

    alt No open PRs
        RR->>RR: Exit (no-op)
    else Has open PRs
        loop For each open PR
            RR->>SRun: repository_dispatch: run-scenarios<br/>payload: {pr_number, branch, sha, repo}
        end
    end
```

**Why this exists:** There's a race condition. The implementation agent might open a PR before the scenario agent finishes writing new tests. The re-run workflow handles this by re-testing all open PRs when new tests land. Worst case, a PR merges before the re-run, and the new tests protect the very next PR. You're never more than one cycle behind.

### The Holdout Wall

The core safety mechanism. Two agents, two repos, one shared interface (specs):

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Implementation Agent (main repo)"
        IA_sees["Can see:<br/>Source code<br/>Internal tests<br/>Specs"]
        IA_cant["Cannot see:<br/>Scenario tests<br/>Scenario repo"]
    end

    subgraph "Specs (shared interface)"
        Specs["docs/specs/*.md<br/>Describes WHAT should happen<br/>Never describes HOW it's tested"]
    end

    subgraph "Scenario Agent (scenarios repo)"
        SA_sees["Can see:<br/>Specs (via dispatch)<br/>Scenario tests<br/>Specs mirror"]
        SA_cant["Cannot see:<br/>Source code<br/>Internal tests"]
    end

    IA_sees --> Specs
    Specs --> SA_sees

    style IA_cant fill:#fcc,stroke:#933
    style SA_cant fill:#fcc,stroke:#933
    style Specs fill:#cfc,stroke:#393
```

This is the same principle as a holdout set in machine learning. If the implementation agent could see the scenario tests, it would optimize to pass them specifically instead of building correct software. By keeping the wall intact, scenario tests catch real behavioral regressions, not test-gaming.

### Scenario Evolution

Scenarios aren't static. When you push new specs, the scenario agent automatically triages them and writes new holdout tests.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[New spec pushed to main] --> B[Spec Dispatch sends to scenarios repo]
    B --> C[Scenario Agent reads spec]
    C --> D{Triage: is this user-facing?}

    D -->|Internal refactor, CI, dev tooling| E[Skip - commit note: 'No scenario changes needed']
    D -->|New user-facing behavior| F[Write new scenario test file]
    D -->|Modified existing behavior| G[Update existing scenario tests]

    F --> H[Commit to scenarios main]
    G --> H
    H --> I[Dispatch scenarios-updated to main repo]
    I --> J[Re-run workflow tests open PRs with new scenarios]

    style D fill:#ffd,stroke:#993
    style E fill:#ddd,stroke:#999
    style F fill:#cfc,stroke:#393
    style G fill:#cfc,stroke:#393
```

**The scenario agent's prompt instructs it to:**
- Act as a QA engineer, never a developer
- Write only behavioral tests (invoke the built artifact, assert on output)
- Never import source code or reference internal implementation
- Use a triage decision tree: SKIP / NEW / UPDATE
- Err on the side of writing a test if the spec is ambiguous

**The specs mirror:** The scenarios repo maintains a `specs/` folder that mirrors every spec it receives. This gives the scenario agent historical context ("what features already exist?") without access to the main repo's codebase.

### The Complete Loop

Here's the full lifecycle from spec to shipped, validated code:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Human as Human (writes specs)
    participant Main as Main Repo
    participant ScAgent as Scenario Agent
    participant ScRepo as Scenarios Repo
    participant ImplAgent as Implementation Agent
    participant Autofix as Autofix Workflow

    Human->>Main: Push spec to docs/specs/
    Main->>ScAgent: spec-pushed dispatch

    par Scenario Generation
        ScAgent->>ScAgent: Triage spec
        ScAgent->>ScRepo: Write/update holdout tests
        ScRepo->>Main: scenarios-updated dispatch
    and Implementation
        Human->>ImplAgent: Execute spec (fresh session)
        ImplAgent->>Main: Open PR
    end

    Main->>Main: CI runs on PR

    alt CI fails
        Main->>Autofix: Autofix workflow triggers
        Autofix->>Main: Push fix, CI re-runs
    end

    alt CI passes
        Main->>ScRepo: run-scenarios dispatch
        ScRepo->>ScRepo: Clone PR branch, build, run holdout tests
        ScRepo->>Main: Post PASS/FAIL comment on PR
    end

    alt Scenarios PASS
        Note over Human,Main: Ready for human review and merge
    else Scenarios FAIL
        Main->>Autofix: Autofix attempts fix
        Note over Autofix,ScRepo: Loop continues (max 3 iterations)
    end
```

### Setup Guide

The fastest way: run `/joycraft-implement-level5` in Claude Code and it walks you through everything interactively. Or follow these steps manually:

#### Step 1: Create a GitHub App

The autofix workflow needs a GitHub App identity to push commits. GitHub blocks workflows from triggering other workflows with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` -- a separate App identity solves this. Creating one takes about 2 minutes:

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/apps/new
2. Give it a name (e.g., "My Project Autofix")
3. Uncheck "Webhook > Active" (not needed)
4. Under **Repository permissions**, set:
   - **Contents**: Read & Write
   - **Pull requests**: Read & Write
   - **Actions**: Read & Write
5. Click **Create GitHub App**
6. Note the **App ID** from the settings page (you'll need it in Step 2)
7. Scroll to **Private keys** > click **Generate a private key**
8. Save the downloaded `.pem` file -- you'll need it in Step 3
9. Click **Install App** in the left sidebar > install it on the repo(s) you want to use

> **Coming soon:** We're working on a shared Joycraft Autofix app that will reduce this to a single click. For now, creating your own app gives you full control and takes just a couple minutes.

#### Step 2: Run the CLI

```bash
npx joycraft init-autofix --scenarios-repo my-project-scenarios --app-id YOUR_APP_ID
```

Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with the App ID from Step 1. This installs the four workflow files in your main repo and copies scenario templates to `docs/templates/scenarios/`.

#### Step 3: Add secrets to your main repo

Go to your repo's **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `JOYCRAFT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` | The full contents of the `.pem` file from Step 1 |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Your Anthropic API key (used by the autofix workflow to run Claude) |

#### Step 4: Create the scenarios repo

```bash
# Create a private repo for holdout tests
gh repo create my-project-scenarios --private

# Copy the scenario templates into it
cp -r docs/templates/scenarios/* ../my-project-scenarios/
cd ../my-project-scenarios
git add -A && git commit -m "init: scaffold scenarios repo from Joycraft"
git push
```

Then add the **same two secrets** (`JOYCRAFT_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) to the scenarios repo's Settings > Secrets.

#### Step 5: Verify

```bash
# Check workflow files exist in your main repo
ls .github/workflows/autofix.yml .github/workflows/scenarios-dispatch.yml \
   .github/workflows/spec-dispatch.yml .github/workflows/scenarios-rerun.yml

# Check scenario templates in the scenarios repo
ls ../my-project-scenarios/workflows/run.yml ../my-project-scenarios/workflows/generate.yml \
   ../my-project-scenarios/prompts/scenario-agent.md ../my-project-scenarios/example-scenario.test.ts
```

#### Step 6: Test it

1. Push a spec to `docs/specs/` on main -- this triggers scenario generation in the scenarios repo
2. Open a PR with a small change -- when CI passes, scenarios run against the PR
3. Watch for the scenario test results posted as a PR comment

Or deliberately break something in a PR to test the autofix loop.

### Cost

Validated in the Pipit trial (~3 minutes, one iteration, zero human intervention). With Claude Sonnet + `--max-turns 20` + max 3 iterations per PR:
- **Autofix:** ~$0.50 per attempt, worst case ~$1.50 per PR (3 iterations)
- **Scenario generation:** ~$0.20 per spec dispatch
- **Solo dev with ~10 PRs/month:** ~$5-10/month for the full loop

The iteration guard and max-turns cap prevent runaway costs.
