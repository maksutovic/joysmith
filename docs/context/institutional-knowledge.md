# Institutional Knowledge

> Unwritten rules and context that AI agents can't derive from code.

## Team Conventions

- Commit style is `verb: concise message` — no conventional commits prefix like `feat:` or `fix:`
- All specs go in `docs/specs/` with date prefix: `YYYY-MM-DD-name.md`
- Feature briefs go in `docs/briefs/` with the same date prefix pattern
- Skills are namespaced `joycraft-*` to avoid collisions with other plugins
- Discoveries are logged in `docs/discoveries/` — capture surprises, not routine work

## Organizational Constraints

- Single maintainer (Maximilian Maksutovic) — all publishing goes through npm trusted publishing via GitHub Actions
- Public open-source project — all code, issues, and PRs are visible
- Users run this via `npx` — no guarantee they have Joycraft installed globally

## Historical Context

- The project was originally called "Joysmith" (repo name) but the package is "Joycraft" — both names appear in various places
- Skill namespacing was added after bare skill names (`tune`, `decompose`) collided with other Claude Code plugins in the wild
- The CLAUDE.md merge logic (`improve-claude-md.ts`) is the most complex and dangerous code — it parses user files and must never destroy content
- Level 5 autofix loop was validated end-to-end on 2026-03-25 with 18 holdout scenarios

## People & Ownership

- Maximilian Maksutovic — sole maintainer, handles all publishing, reviews all PRs
- The "craft" metaphor is intentional — Joycraft enables human contextual stewardship of AI-assisted development
