# Joycraft

> The craft of AI development — with joy, not darkness.

**Joycraft** is a CLI tool and Claude Code plugin that takes any project from Level 1 to Level 4 on [Dan Shapiro's 5 Levels of Vibe Coding](https://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2026/01/the-five-levels-from-spicy-autocomplete-to-the-software-factory/). One command gives you behavioral boundaries, atomic spec workflows, skill-driven development, and structured knowledge capture.

The name is a deliberate counter-narrative to "dark factory." Autonomous software development should bring craft and joy to engineering, not darkness.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx joycraft init
```

That's it. Joycraft auto-detects your tech stack and creates:

- **CLAUDE.md** with behavioral boundaries (Always / Ask First / Never) and correct build/test/lint commands
- **AGENTS.md** for Codex compatibility
- **Claude Code skills** installed to `.claude/skills/`:
  - `/tune` — Assess your harness, apply upgrades, see your path to Level 5
  - `/new-feature` — Interview → Feature Brief → Atomic Specs
  - `/interview` — Lightweight brainstorm — yap about ideas, get a structured summary
  - `/decompose` — Break a brief into small, testable specs
  - `/session-end` — Capture discoveries, verify, commit
- **docs/** structure — `briefs/`, `specs/`, `discoveries/`, `contracts/`, `decisions/`
- **Templates** — Atomic spec, feature brief, implementation plan, boundary framework

### Supported Stacks

Node.js (npm/pnpm/yarn/bun), Python (poetry/pip/uv), Rust, Go, Swift, and generic (Makefile/Dockerfile).

Frameworks auto-detected: Next.js, FastAPI, Django, Flask, Actix, Axum, Express, Remix, and more.

## The Workflow

After init, open Claude Code and use the installed skills:

```
/tune                  # Assess your harness, apply upgrades, see path to Level 5
/interview             # Brainstorm freely — yap about ideas, get a structured summary
/new-feature           # Interview → Feature Brief → Atomic Specs → ready to execute
/decompose             # Break any feature into small, independent specs
/session-end           # Wrap up — discoveries, verification, commit
```

The core loop:

```
Interview → Spec → Fresh Session → Execute → Discoveries → Ship
```

## Upgrade

When Joycraft templates and skills evolve, update without losing your customizations:

```bash
npx joycraft upgrade
```

Joycraft tracks what it installed vs. what you've customized. Unmodified files update automatically. Customized files show a diff and ask before overwriting. Use `--yes` for CI.

## How It Works with AI Agents

**Claude Code** reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically and discovers skills in `.claude/skills/`. The behavioral boundaries guide every action. The skills provide structured workflows accessible via `/slash-commands`.

**Codex** reads `AGENTS.md` — same boundaries and commands in a concise format optimized for smaller context windows.

Both agents get the same guardrails and the same development workflow. Joycraft doesn't write your project code — it builds the *system* that makes AI-assisted development reliable.

### Team Sharing

Skills live in `.claude/skills/` which is **not** gitignored by default. Commit it so your whole team gets the workflow:

```bash
git add .claude/skills/ docs/
git commit -m "add: Joycraft harness"
```

Joycraft also installs a session-start hook that checks for updates — if your templates are outdated, you'll see a one-line nudge when Claude Code starts.

## Why This Exists

Most developers using AI tools are at Level 2 — they prompt, they iterate, they feel productive. But [METR's randomized control trial](https://metr.org/) found experienced developers using AI tools actually completed tasks **19% slower**, while *believing* they were 24% faster. The problem isn't the tools. It's the absence of structure around them.

The teams seeing transformative results — [StrongDM](https://factory.strongdm.ai/) shipping an entire product with 3 engineers, [Spotify Honk](https://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2026/01/the-five-levels-from-spicy-autocomplete-to-the-software-factory/) merging 1,000 PRs every 10 days, Anthropic generating effectively 100% of their code with AI — all share the same pattern: **they don't prompt AI to write code. They write specs and let AI execute them.**

Joycraft packages that pattern into something anyone can install.

### The methodology

Joycraft's approach is synthesized from several sources:

**Spec-driven development.** Instead of prompting AI in conversation, you write structured specifications — Feature Briefs that capture the *what* and *why*, then Atomic Specs that break work into small, testable, independently executable units. Each spec is self-contained: an agent can pick it up without reading anything else. This follows [Addy Osmani's](https://addyosmani.com/blog/good-spec/) principles for AI-consumable specs and [GitHub's Spec Kit](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/spec-driven-development-with-ai-get-started-with-a-new-open-source-toolkit/) 4-phase process (Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement).

**Context isolation.** [Boris Cherny](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/head-of-claude-code-what-happens) (Head of Claude Code at Anthropic) recommends: interview in one session, write the spec, then execute in a *fresh session* with clean context. Joycraft's `/new-feature` → `/decompose` → execute workflow enforces this naturally. The interview session captures intent; the execution session has only the spec.

**Behavioral boundaries.** CLAUDE.md isn't a suggestion box — it's a contract. Joycraft installs a three-tier boundary framework (Always / Ask First / Never) that prevents the most common AI development failures: overwriting user files, skipping tests, pushing without approval, hardcoding secrets. This is [Addy Osmani's](https://addyosmani.com/blog/good-spec/) "boundaries" principle made concrete.

**Knowledge capture over session notes.** Most session notes are never re-read. Joycraft's `/session-end` skill captures only *discoveries* — assumptions that were wrong, APIs that behaved unexpectedly, decisions made during implementation that aren't in the spec. If nothing surprising happened, you capture nothing. This keeps the signal-to-noise ratio high.

**External holdout scenarios.** [StrongDM's Software Factory](https://factory.strongdm.ai/) proved that AI agents will [actively game visible test suites](https://palisaderesearch.org/blog/specification-gaming). Their solution: scenarios that live *outside* the codebase, invisible to the agent during development. Like a holdout set in ML, this prevents overfitting. Joycraft provides the template for building these.

**The 5-level framework.** [Dan Shapiro's levels](https://www.danshapiro.com/blog/2026/01/the-five-levels-from-spicy-autocomplete-to-the-software-factory/) give you a map. Level 2 (Junior Developer) is where most teams plateau. Level 3 (Developer as Manager) means your life is diffs. Level 4 (Developer as PM) means you write specs, not code. Level 5 (Dark Factory) means specs in, software out. Joycraft's `/tune` assessment tells you where you are and what to do next.
