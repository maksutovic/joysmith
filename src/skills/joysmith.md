# Joysmith — Project Harness Assessment

You are evaluating this project's AI development harness. Follow these steps in order.

## Step 1: Detect Harness State

Check the following and note what exists:

1. **CLAUDE.md** — Read it if it exists. Check whether it contains meaningful content (not just a project name or generic README).
2. **Key directories** — Check for: `docs/specs/`, `docs/briefs/`, `docs/discoveries/`, `docs/templates/`, `.claude/skills/`
3. **Boundary framework** — Look for `Always`, `Ask First`, and `Never` sections in CLAUDE.md (or similar behavioral constraints under any heading).
4. **Skills infrastructure** — Check `.claude/skills/` for installed skill files.
5. **Test configuration** — Look for test commands in package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, Makefile, or CI config files.

## Step 2: Route Based on State

### If No Harness (no CLAUDE.md, or CLAUDE.md is just a README with no structured sections):

Tell the user:
- Their project has no AI development harness
- Recommend running `npx joysmith init` to scaffold one
- Briefly explain what it sets up: CLAUDE.md with boundaries, spec/brief templates, skills, documentation structure
- **Stop here** — do not run the full assessment on a bare project

### If Harness Exists (CLAUDE.md has structured content — boundaries, commands, architecture, or domain rules):

Continue to Step 3 for the full assessment.

## Step 3: Score 7 Dimensions

Read CLAUDE.md thoroughly. Explore the project structure. Score each dimension on a 1-5 scale with specific evidence.

### Dimension 1: Spec Quality

Look in `docs/specs/` for specification files.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | No specs directory or no spec files |
| 2 | Specs exist but are informal notes or TODOs |
| 3 | Specs have structure (sections, some criteria) but lack consistency |
| 4 | Specs are structured with clear acceptance criteria and constraints |
| 5 | Atomic specs: self-contained, acceptance criteria, constraints, edge cases, affected files |

**Evidence:** Number of specs found, example of best/worst, whether acceptance criteria are present.

### Dimension 2: Spec Granularity

Can each spec be completed in a single coding session?

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | No specs |
| 2 | Specs cover entire features or epics |
| 3 | Specs are feature-sized (multi-session but bounded) |
| 4 | Most specs are session-sized with clear scope |
| 5 | All specs are atomic — one session, one concern, clear done state |

### Dimension 3: Behavioral Boundaries

Read CLAUDE.md for explicit behavioral constraints.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | No CLAUDE.md or no behavioral guidance |
| 2 | CLAUDE.md exists with general instructions but no structured boundaries |
| 3 | Some boundaries exist but not organized as Always/Ask First/Never |
| 4 | Always/Ask First/Never sections present with reasonable coverage |
| 5 | Comprehensive boundaries covering code style, testing, deployment, dependencies, and dangerous operations |

**Important:** Projects may have strong rules under different headings (e.g., "Critical Rules", "Constraints"). Give credit for substance over format — a project with clear, enforced rules scores higher than one with empty Always/Ask First/Never sections.

### Dimension 4: Skills & Hooks

Look in `.claude/skills/` for skill files. Check for hooks configuration.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | No .claude/ directory |
| 2 | .claude/ exists but empty or minimal |
| 3 | A few skills installed, no hooks |
| 4 | Multiple relevant skills, basic hooks |
| 5 | Comprehensive skills covering workflow, hooks for validation |

### Dimension 5: Documentation

Examine `docs/` directory structure and content.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | No docs/ directory |
| 2 | docs/ exists with ad-hoc files |
| 3 | Some structure (subdirectories) but inconsistent |
| 4 | Structured docs/ with templates and clear organization |
| 5 | Full structure: briefs/, specs/, templates/, architecture docs, referenced from CLAUDE.md |

### Dimension 6: Knowledge Capture

Look for discoveries, decisions, and session notes.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | No knowledge capture mechanism |
| 2 | Ad-hoc notes in random locations |
| 3 | A dedicated notes or decisions directory exists |
| 4 | Structured discoveries/decisions directory with entries |
| 5 | Active capture: discoveries with entries, session-end workflow, decision log |

### Dimension 7: Testing & Validation

Look for test config, CI setup, and validation commands.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | No test configuration |
| 2 | Test framework installed but few/no tests |
| 3 | Tests exist with reasonable coverage |
| 4 | Tests + CI pipeline configured |
| 5 | Tests + CI + validation commands in CLAUDE.md + scenario tests |

## Step 4: Write Assessment

Write the assessment to `docs/joysmith-assessment.md` AND display it in the conversation. Use this format:

```markdown
# Joysmith Assessment — [Project Name]

**Date:** [today's date]
**Overall Level:** [1-5, based on average score]

## Scores

| Dimension | Score | Summary |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Spec Quality | X/5 | [one-line summary] |
| Spec Granularity | X/5 | [one-line summary] |
| Behavioral Boundaries | X/5 | [one-line summary] |
| Skills & Hooks | X/5 | [one-line summary] |
| Documentation | X/5 | [one-line summary] |
| Knowledge Capture | X/5 | [one-line summary] |
| Testing & Validation | X/5 | [one-line summary] |

**Average:** X.X/5

## Detailed Findings

### [Dimension Name] — X/5
**Evidence:** [specific files, paths, counts found]
**Gap:** [what's missing]
**Recommendation:** [specific action to improve]

## Upgrade Plan

To reach Level [current + 1], complete these steps:
1. [Most impactful action] — addresses [dimension] (X -> Y)
2. [Next action] — addresses [dimension] (X -> Y)
[up to 5 actions, ordered by impact]
```

## Step 5: Offer to Apply Fixes

After presenting the assessment, ask the user:

"Would you like me to start applying these upgrades? I'll go through each recommendation and ask before making changes to your CLAUDE.md or project files."

If the user agrees, work through the upgrade plan one item at a time:
- For each recommendation, explain what you'll do and ask for confirmation
- **Always ask before modifying CLAUDE.md** — show what you'll add
- Creating missing directories is safe to do without asking
- Installing missing templates is safe if the directory is empty
- After applying changes, briefly re-score the affected dimensions to show improvement

## Edge Cases

- **Not a git repo:** Note this. Joysmith works best in a git repo.
- **CLAUDE.md is just a README:** Treat as "no harness."
- **Non-Joysmith skills already installed:** Acknowledge them. Do not replace — suggest additions.
- **Monorepo:** Assess the root CLAUDE.md. Note if component-level CLAUDE.md files exist.
- **Project has rules under non-standard headings:** Give credit. Suggest reformatting as Always/Ask First/Never but acknowledge the rules are there.
