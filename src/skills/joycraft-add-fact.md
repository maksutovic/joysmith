# Add Fact

The user has a fact to capture. Your job is to classify it, route it to the correct context document, append it in the right format, and optionally add a CLAUDE.md boundary rule.

## Step 1: Get the Fact

If the user already provided the fact (e.g., `/joycraft-add-fact the staging DB resets every Sunday`), use it directly.

If not, ask: "What fact do you want to capture?" -- then wait for their response.

If the user provides multiple facts at once, process each one separately through all the steps below, then give a combined confirmation at the end.

## Step 2: Classify the Fact

Route the fact to one of these 5 context documents based on its content:

### `docs/context/production-map.md`
The fact is about **infrastructure, services, environments, URLs, endpoints, credentials, or what is safe/unsafe to touch**.
- Signal words: "production", "staging", "endpoint", "URL", "database", "service", "deployed", "hosted", "credentials", "secret", "environment"
- Examples: "The staging DB is at postgres://staging.example.com", "We use Vercel for the frontend and Railway for the API"

### `docs/context/dangerous-assumptions.md`
The fact is about **something an AI agent might get wrong -- a false assumption that leads to bad outcomes**.
- Signal words: "assumes", "might think", "but actually", "looks like X but is Y", "not what it seems", "trap", "gotcha"
- Examples: "The `users` table looks like a test table but it's production", "Deleting a workspace doesn't delete the billing subscription"

### `docs/context/decision-log.md`
The fact is about **an architectural or tooling choice and why it was made**.
- Signal words: "decided", "chose", "because", "instead of", "we went with", "the reason we use", "trade-off"
- Examples: "We chose SQLite over Postgres because this runs on embedded devices", "We use pnpm instead of npm for workspace support"

### `docs/context/institutional-knowledge.md`
The fact is about **team conventions, unwritten rules, organizational context, or who owns what**.
- Signal words: "convention", "rule", "always", "never", "team", "process", "review", "approval", "owns", "responsible"
- Examples: "The design team reviews all color changes", "We never deploy on Fridays", "PR titles must start with the ticket number"

### `docs/context/troubleshooting.md`
The fact is about **diagnostic knowledge -- when X happens, do Y (or don't do Z)**.
- Signal words: "when", "fails", "error", "if you see", "stuck", "broken", "fix", "workaround", "before trying", "reboot", "restart", "reset"
- Examples: "If Wi-Fi disconnects during flash, wait and retry -- don't switch networks", "When tests fail with ECONNREFUSED, check if Docker is running"

### Ambiguous Facts

If the fact fits multiple categories, pick the **best fit** based on the primary intent. You will mention the alternative in your confirmation message so the user can correct you.

## Step 3: Ensure the Target Document Exists

1. If `docs/context/` does not exist, create the directory.
2. If the target document does not exist, create it from the template structure. Check `docs/templates/` for the matching template. If no template exists, use this minimal structure:

For **production-map.md**:
```markdown
# Production Map

> What's real, what's staging, what's safe to touch.

## Services

| Service | Environment | URL/Endpoint | Impact if Corrupted |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
```

For **dangerous-assumptions.md**:
```markdown
# Dangerous Assumptions

> Things the AI agent might assume that are wrong in this project.

## Assumptions

| Agent Might Assume | But Actually | Impact If Wrong |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
```

For **decision-log.md**:
```markdown
# Decision Log

> Why choices were made, not just what was chosen.

## Decisions

| Date | Decision | Why | Alternatives Rejected | Revisit When |
|------|----------|-----|----------------------|-------------|
```

For **institutional-knowledge.md**:
```markdown
# Institutional Knowledge

> Unwritten rules, team conventions, and organizational context.

## Team Conventions

- (none yet)
```

For **troubleshooting.md**:
```markdown
# Troubleshooting

> What to do when things go wrong for non-code reasons.

## Common Failures

| When This Happens | Do This | Don't Do This |
|-------------------|---------|---------------|
```

## Step 4: Read the Target Document

Read the target document to understand its current structure. Note:
- Which section to append to
- Whether it uses tables or lists
- The column format if it's a table

## Step 5: Append the Fact

Add the fact to the appropriate section of the target document. Match the existing format exactly:

- **Table-based documents** (production-map, dangerous-assumptions, decision-log, troubleshooting): Add a new table row in the correct columns. Use today's date where a date column exists.
- **List-based documents** (institutional-knowledge): Add a new list item (`- `) to the most appropriate section.

Remove any italic example rows (rows where all cells start with `_`) before appending, so the document transitions from template to real content. Only remove examples from the specific table you are appending to.

**Append only. Never modify or remove existing real content.**

## Step 6: Evaluate CLAUDE.md Boundary Rule

Decide whether the fact also warrants a rule in CLAUDE.md's behavioral boundaries:

**Add a CLAUDE.md rule if the fact:**
- Describes something that should ALWAYS or NEVER be done
- Could cause real damage if violated (data loss, broken deployments, security issues)
- Is a hard constraint that applies across all work, not just a one-time note

**Do NOT add a CLAUDE.md rule if the fact is:**
- Purely informational (e.g., "staging DB is at this URL")
- A one-time decision that's already captured
- A diagnostic tip rather than a prohibition

If a rule is warranted, read CLAUDE.md, find the appropriate section (ALWAYS, ASK FIRST, or NEVER under Behavioral Boundaries), and append the rule. If no Behavioral Boundaries section exists, append one.

## Step 7: Confirm

Report what you did in this format:

```
Added to [document name]:
  [summary of what was added]

[If CLAUDE.md was also updated:]
Added CLAUDE.md rule:
  [ALWAYS/ASK FIRST/NEVER]: [rule text]

[If the fact was ambiguous:]
Routed to [chosen doc] -- move to [alternative doc] if this is more about [alternative category description].
```
